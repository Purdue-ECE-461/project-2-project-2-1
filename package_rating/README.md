Group 1 for Project 2 ---------------------------------------------------------

This is the Project 1 implementation that we inherited from a previous team to use in our Project 2.

It currently only passed 15/20 of their test cases.
We are endeavoring to change that to 20/20.

It currently requires you to have 3 Environmental variables set in your .env

These can be manually set in a unix enviroment via the export command.

The 3 variables are
GITHUB_TOKEN
LOG_LEVEL
LOG_FILE

The commands to set these variables are:

export GITHUB_TOKEN="XXXX"
export LOG_LEVEL=2
export LOG_FILE="project-1-24.log"

Changelog:

To pass one test, all that was needed was specifying the exact LOG_FILE as the one Team24 used: project-1-24.log
